NEWS for rsync 3.0.9 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.8:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fix a crash bug in checksum scanning when --inplace is used.

    - Fix a hang if a hard-linked file cannot be opened by the sender (e.g.
      if it has no read permission).

    - Fix preservation of a symlink's system xattrs (e.g. selinux) on Linux.

    - Fix a bug with the modifying of unwritable directories.

    - Fix --fake-super's interaction with --link-dest same-file comparisons.

    - Fix the updating of the curr_dir buffer to avoid a duplicate slash.

    - Make daemon-excluded file errors more error-like.

    - Fix a compilation issue on older C compilers (due to a misplaced var
      declaration).

    - Fix some issues with the post-processing of the man pages.
